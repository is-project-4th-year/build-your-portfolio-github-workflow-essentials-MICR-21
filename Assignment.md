## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### 1. Project Boards

- Expectation : I didnt think one needed a project board to code work in teams.

- Reality: In reality it serves a visual representation of a to do list that helps in tracking one's progress. Also moving from to-do to done and vide versa was also a bit satisfying.

- Impact: Helped in organisation and clear movements of tasks from one checklist to the next.

### 2. Git Branching

- Expectation: I didnt expect us to create a branch for each new feature one would add. I just thought we would us the common branches e.g test and i thought it would be a bit hard to manage.

- Reality:Creating branches for each section e.g landing page, feature section was very straightforward and it did make my work tree clean.

- Impact: Branching allowed me to work on different parts of the project without messing up the main portfolio.

### 3. Pull Requests

- Expectation: I assumed pull requests were only for big open-source projects with many contributors.

- Reality: Even for my small project, Pull Requests made it easy to review changes and link them to specific issues.

- Impact: It improved my workflow, ensured issues were properly closed, and kept my commits structured.

### 4. Merge Conflict Resolution

- Expectation: I thought resolving merge conflicts would be stressful and very technical.

- Reality: With guidance, it was manageable. The key is understanding the conflict markers and carefully choosing the correct code.

- Impact: Gave me confidence to handle version control issues and kept my project stable even after conflicts.

### E. Merge Conflict Resolution
